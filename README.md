# News Article Classification

*Teammate: Valerios Stais*

The goal of this project was to create models able to correctly classify articles belonging in one of the following categories, *entertainment, business, health, technology*.  We focused on extracting as much information as possible with a refined preprocessing of the text. Then we aimed for the best accuracy finding the most appropriate combination of model and hyper-parameters using Bayesian optimization.

For a detailed explanation of the steps we followed to achieve an as good as possible classifier we suggest reading `report.pdf`.
